This follows a similar form to the generalized tensorflow_loader. However, it will only classify images as "[object]" or "[not object]", where [object] is an argument of the function run_all. Filenames must also include "true" if the photo contains [object], or [false] if it does not.

Filename examples: true_1.png; false_2.png. The indentifying integer is not taken into account by the program
